Project Landing Page (The Odin Project)

This project has the goal to be an exercise to practise fundamentals of HTML and CSS.
The idea is to create an entire web page from a design provided.
Just for the sake of increasing difficulty some styles will be tweaked to my personal taste, but the general concept should be preserved.
